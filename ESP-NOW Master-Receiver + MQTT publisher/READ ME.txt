the goal was to use the same esp32 board to be an esp-now receiver and mqtt publisher both at the same time , but after adding more than 2 sender-boards to the project and since esp-now is based on wifi and the board sends data to mqtt broker via wifi too , it couldnt handle both tasks so we decided to split the workload , we Added an esp01 so now , the esp32 receiver only acts a master receiver for all sensors/other esp32 boards , and then sends the data via serial to the esp01 board which forwards that data to mqtt broker , and now our esp-now receiver can handle more sender-boards
